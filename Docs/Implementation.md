## Technical Constraints & Considerations

### Performance Requirements:

- Feed and Explore pages must load in < 2 seconds
- Real-time updates must appear within 100ms
- Image thumbnails must be optimized and served via CDN
- Materialized view refresh should not block user queries

### Scalability Considerations:

- Start with Upstash Redis for rate limiting (migrate to BullMQ + managed Redis if needed)
- Use Supabase connection pooling for database connections
- Implement pagination for all list views
- Cache hot pages in Redis

### Security Requirements:

- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- RLS policies must be tested thoroughly before public launch
- Rate limiting must be enforced on all user-facing APIs
- Authentication tokens must be properly secured
- Extension must use short-lived tokens

### Anti-Abuse Measures:

- Implement all rate limits as specified in PRD
- Device fingerprinting for sockpuppet detection
- Quality score system to throttle low-quality users
- Automated moderation for comments
- Fraud detection workers for anomaly detection

## Timeline Summary

- **Stage 1 (Foundation):** 1-2 weeks
- **Stage 2 (Core Features):** 3-4 weeks
- **Stage 3 (Advanced Features):** 2-3 weeks
- **Stage 4 (Polish & Optimization):** 1-2 weeks

**Total Estimated Duration:** 7-11 weeks (approximately 2-3 months)
