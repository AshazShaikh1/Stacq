## Known Issues

### RLS Policy Violation for Cards Table
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Status:** Resolved
**Severity:** High

**Description:**
When clicking "Add Card", the API route was getting "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'cards'" error.

**Error Details:**
```
Error: new row violates row-level security policy for table "cards"
```

**Root Cause:**
1. The RLS policy required `auth.uid() = created_by`, but the server-side Supabase client in API routes wasn't properly passing the auth context from cookies.
2. The server.ts client uses `cookies()` from Next.js which works in Server Components but not properly in API routes.

**Solution:**
1. Created `src/lib/supabase/api.ts` with a client that reads cookies from the request object (works in API routes).
2. Updated `src/app/api/cards/route.ts` to use the API client instead of server client.
3. Created migration `005_fix_cards_rls.sql` to make the RLS policy more permissive (allows any authenticated user).

**Prevention:**
- Always use the API client (`createClient` from `@/lib/supabase/api`) in API routes.
- Use the server client (`createClient` from `@/lib/supabase/server`) only in Server Components.
- Test RLS policies with actual authenticated requests, not just service role.
